# Benefits of High Availability and Scalability in the Cloud

### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**
- **High availability** and **scalability** are essential when deploying cloud applications to ensure uptime and meet demand.

### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **High Availability**: The ability of a system to remain operational and accessible even during disruptions.
- **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Guarantees provided by cloud providers (e.g., Azure) for uptime.
- **Scalability**: The capability to adjust resources (increase or decrease) based on demand.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Enhancing a resource’s capacity (e.g., adding CPUs or RAM to a VM).
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Increasing or decreasing the number of resources (e.g., adding or removing VMs/containers).

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- High availability is critical for ensuring that applications are always accessible, backed by SLAs.
- Scalability enables efficient resource use: you only pay for what you consume and can adjust as needed.

- **High Availability Examples:**
  - Azure provides uptime guarantees through its SLAs, ensuring resources are available even during unexpected events.
- **Scalability Examples:**
  - During peak traffic, additional virtual machines can be deployed (horizontal scaling) to manage increased load.
  - When more processing power is needed, you can upgrade the hardware (vertical scaling) of a virtual machine.
  - Cloud’s consumption-based model means you reduce costs by scaling down when demand drops.
