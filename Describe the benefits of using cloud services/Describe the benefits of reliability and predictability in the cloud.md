## Reliability

### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **Reliability**: The ability of a system to recover from failures and keep functioning.
- **Azure Well-Architected Framework**: A set of principles that includes reliability as a pillar for robust cloud solutions.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- The cloudâ€™s decentralized design supports a **global scale** infrastructure.
- Resources can be spread across multiple regions to ensure service continuity even during regional failures.

- **Example**: If one region experiences a catastrophic event, other regions remain operational and may automatically take over without manual intervention.

## Predictability

### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **Predictability**: The ability to forecast performance and costs in a cloud environment.
- **Performance Predictability**: Ensuring you have the right resources to deliver a positive user experience.
- **Cost Predictability**: The ability to forecast and manage cloud spending effectively.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- The Azure Well-Architected Framework helps achieve both performance and cost predictability.
- Predictable performance and costs let you scale and manage resources confidently.

### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**
- **Performance Examples**:
  - **Autoscaling**: Automatically adds resources when demand spikes and scales back down when it drops.
  - **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic evenly to prevent any single resource from becoming overloaded.
- **Cost Examples**:
  - **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor usage to avoid overpaying for idle resources.
  - **Forecasting Tools**: Use tools like the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator or Pricing Calculator to estimate future expenses.
