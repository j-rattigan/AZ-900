# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

#### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**
- **IaaS** is the most flexible cloud service model, providing maximum control over your cloud resources.
- In an IaaS model, you **rent hardware** from a cloud datacenter while you control how itâ€™s used.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **IaaS**: Cloud service where the provider maintains physical hardware, network connectivity, and security.
- **Control**: You are responsible for installing, configuring, and maintaining the operating system, network, databases, and storage.
- **Cloud Datacenter**: The facility housing the hardware that you rent.

- The **shared responsibility model** means that while the provider manages the physical infrastructure, you handle software-level responsibilities.
- This model gives you both flexibility and the need for proactive management of your cloud environment.

- **Shared Responsibility Model:**
  - **Provider's Role:** Maintains the physical infrastructure and network connectivity.
  - **Your Role:** Responsible for installation, configuration, patching, updates, and security.
- **Scenarios:**
  - **Lift-and-Shift Migration:** Move on-premise applications directly to IaaS, keeping a similar setup.
  - **Testing and Development:** Quickly replicate environments to start up or shut down resources as needed, all while maintaining complete control.
