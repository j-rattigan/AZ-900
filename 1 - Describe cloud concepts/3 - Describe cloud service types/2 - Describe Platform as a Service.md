# Platform as a Service (PaaS)

#### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**
- PaaS is a middle ground between renting data center space (IaaS) and using a complete solution (SaaS).
- It offloads much of the infrastructure and platform maintenance to the cloud provider.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **PaaS**: A cloud service model that provides not only the hardware but also the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services.
- **Middleware**: Software that connects and integrates various applications and services.
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: In PaaS, the cloud provider handles the physical infrastructure, OS, databases, and development tools, while you manage your applications and possibly networking.

- PaaS is ideal for developing and deploying applications without the headache of managing underlying infrastructure.
- It simplifies development by offering built-in features like scalability, high availability, and multi-tenant capabilities.

- **Shared Responsibility in PaaS:**
  - **Provider's Role:** Maintains physical infrastructure, network connectivity, operating systems, databases, and development tools.
  - **Your Role:** Focus on developing and managing your application code and, depending on the setup, managing some networking or security settings.
- **Scenarios:**
  - **Development Framework:** Use PaaS to build or customize applications with pre-built software components (like using an Excel macro), reducing the amount of coding required.
  - **Analytics/Business Intelligence:** Leverage built-in analytical tools to mine data, identify trends, and improve decision-making without managing the underlying hardware.
