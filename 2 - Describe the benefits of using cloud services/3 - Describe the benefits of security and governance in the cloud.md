# Benefits of Security and Governance in the Cloud

### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**
- **Security** and **governance** in the cloud ensure that your IT resources are both protected and compliant.
- They enable you to deploy resources confidently, knowing that corporate standards and regulatory requirements are met.

### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **Governance**: The use of set templates, auditing, and policies to ensure resources meet standards.
- **Compliance**: Adherence to corporate standards and government regulations.
- **Security**: Measures and features that protect IT resources from threats (e.g., DDoS attacks).
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides physical resources with user-managed operating systems and software.
- **PaaS/SaaS (Platform/Software as a Service)**: Offers automated patches, updates, and maintenance.

- Cloud-based governance lets you update all deployed resources to new standards as they evolve.
- Security in the cloud is adaptable: you can choose a solution that offers maximum control (IaaS) or automated management (PaaS/SaaS).
- Cloud providers are built to handle threats like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, making your network more robust.

- **Governance Examples:**
  - **Set Templates:** Automatically ensure all resources meet corporate and regulatory requirements.
  - **Cloud-Based Auditing:** Flags resources that are out of compliance and suggests mitigation strategies.
  - **Automatic Patching:** Depending on your model, updates may be applied automatically.
- **Security Examples:**
  - **IaaS:** Provides physical resources while allowing you to manage operating systems and patches.
  - **PaaS/SaaS:** Takes care of patches and maintenance automatically.
  - **DDoS Protection:** Cloud providers mitigate attacks to keep your network secure.
- **Governance Footprint:** Establishing strong governance early helps keep your cloud resources updated, secure, and well managed.
