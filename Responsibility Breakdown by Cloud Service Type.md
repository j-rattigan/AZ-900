# Responsibility Breakdown by Cloud Service Type

#### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**
The responsibility between the cloud provider and consumer changes depending on the cloud service model being used.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: The cloud provider offers the **basic infrastructure** like virtual machines, storage, and networking. The consumer manages everything **above** that (e.g., operating systems, apps, databases).
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: The cloud provider gives the infrastructure and platform to run your applications. The consumer is responsible for managing **applications** and **data**.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: The cloud provider manages **everything**. The consumer **only uses** the software application (e.g., email, file sharing).

#### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- **IaaS**: You are responsible for the **operating system**, **applications**, and **data**.
- **PaaS**: You are responsible for **applications** and **data**.
- **SaaS**: You **only use** the software; the cloud provider takes care of **everything** else.

#### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**
- **IaaS**:
  - Consumer manages the **OS** (Operating System), **applications**, and **data**.
  - Cloud provider only manages the **physical infrastructure** and **network**.
  - Example: Virtual machines (VMs) running on a cloud provider’s infrastructure. The consumer installs and manages everything from the operating system up.
  
- **PaaS**:
  - Consumer is responsible for **deploying applications** and **managing data**.
  - Cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure and platform.
  - Example: Using a platform like **Azure App Services** to deploy applications. You only manage the app, the rest (network, storage) is handled by the provider.
  
- **SaaS**:
  - Consumer only uses the **software** provided by the cloud provider (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace).
  - Cloud provider manages **everything** (infrastructure, platform, updates, security).
  - Example: Using **Microsoft Teams** for collaboration. You don’t manage any infrastructure or software updates – the provider does.

---

#### **Summary**:
- **IaaS**: You manage the OS, apps, and data.
- **PaaS**: You manage the apps and data.
- **SaaS**: You just use the app, the provider manages everything else.
