# Microsoft Defender for Cloud Overview

## **Yellow: Main Idea**
**Microsoft Defender for Cloud** is a **security posture management and threat protection tool** that monitors cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and multicloud environments. It provides guidance and notifications to enhance your security.

## **Blue: Supporting Details**
- **Protection everywhere you're deployed:** Itâ€™s integrated with Azure, but can also extend protection to on-premises and other cloud environments.
- **Deployment:** Easy, as it is natively integrated with Azure, and can deploy a Log Analytics agent to gather data when necessary.
  
## **Green: Examples/ Facts**
- Azure-native service automatically monitors Azure services like Azure App Service, Azure SQL, and Azure Storage Account.
- For hybrid and multicloud environments, Defender for Cloud extends protection to non-Azure machines with the help of **Azure Arc**.

## **Yellow: Main Idea**
**Defender for Cloud** provides **security in various environments** such as Azure, hybrid, and multicloud.

## **Blue: Supporting Details**
- **Azure-native protections** help detect threats across:
  - Azure PaaS services, including **Azure App Service, Azure SQL, Azure Storage**.
  - Azure data services, with automatic classification in **Azure SQL**.
  - Networks, preventing brute force attacks and restricting VM access.
  
- **Hybrid and Multicloud Environments:**
  - Add capabilities to non-Azure servers using **Azure Arc**.
  - Protects AWS and GCP resources as well.

## **Green: Examples/ Facts**
- **CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)** extends to AWS with security assessments and compliance checks.
- **Microsoft Defender for Containers** extends protection to **Amazon EKS Linux clusters**.

## **Yellow: Main Idea**
**Defender for Cloud** helps you **assess, secure, and defend** your environment.

## **Blue: Supporting Details**
1. **Continuously Assess:**
   - Track vulnerabilities and security posture.
   - Use vulnerability assessment tools for servers, container registries, and SQL servers.
   
2. **Secure:**
   - Harden resources using the **Azure Security Benchmark** and enforce security policies.
   - Monitor new resources to ensure they follow best practices.

3. **Defend:**
   - Generate **security alerts** and advanced **threat protection** features.

## **Green: Examples/ Facts**
- **Defender for Servers** includes integration with **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** to access vulnerability management data.
- **Azure Security Benchmark** helps with security standards and guidelines based on common compliance frameworks.
- **Secure score** helps measure and improve security posture.

## **Yellow: Main Idea**
**Security Alerts** and **Advanced Threat Protection** are key components of Defender for Cloud.

## **Blue: Supporting Details**
- **Security Alerts**:
  - Describe affected resources.
  - Suggest remediation steps and trigger logic apps.
  
- **Advanced Threat Protection**:
  - Provides protections for resources like VMs, SQL databases, containers, and networks.

## **Green: Examples/ Facts**
- **Fusion kill-chain analysis** correlates alerts for better understanding of cyber attack sequences and impact on resources.
- **Just-in-time VM access** and **adaptive application controls** help secure management ports and control app execution.
