### Azure Containers
- Containers are a **lightweight virtualization environment** that allow you to run multiple instances of an application on a **single host**.
- Unlike virtual machines, you **don’t manage the operating system** for containers.
- **Containers** are agile and designed for **scaling out**, **stopping dynamically**, and responding to changes **on demand**.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **Containers**: A virtualization environment that runs multiple applications on a single host without managing the operating system.
- **Lightweight**: Containers are smaller and faster than virtual machines, allowing for quicker deployment and scaling.
- **Container Engine (Docker)**: A popular container engine supported by Azure, used to manage and run containers.

#### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- **Containers** are a more **agile** solution than **virtual machines**.
- They're ideal for responding to changes and **quickly recovering** from crashes or interruptions.
- **Docker** is one of the most widely used **container engines** for building and managing containers.

#### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**
- **Virtual Machines** vs. **Containers**: VMs require managing the **operating system**, while containers are more **dynamic** and efficient.
- **Azure Containers** are great for running applications without the need to manage **VMs** or additional services.

### Azure Container Instances
- **Azure Container Instances (ACI)** is the simplest way to run a container in Azure.
- **PaaS offering** that runs containers for you without managing VMs.
- **No need for additional services** – upload your container and let ACI handle it.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: A cloud service model where the cloud provider manages infrastructure, enabling you to focus on applications and services.
- **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**: A PaaS offering in Azure for running containers without VM management.

#### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- ACI simplifies container deployment by removing the need for **VM management** or additional infrastructure.

#### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**
- You can upload your **containers**, and **ACI runs** them for you, making it easy to get started quickly.

### Azure Container Apps
- **Azure Container Apps** provide similar benefits to **ACI**.
- **PaaS offering** that allows you to get running quickly and eliminates container management.
- Added benefits include **load balancing** and **scaling**, making your design more **elastic**.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **Azure Container Apps**: PaaS offering for containers with added benefits such as **load balancing** and **scaling**.

#### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- **Elastic design** allows your app to adapt based on the demand and resources.

#### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**
- **Load balancing** and **scaling** enhance the flexibility of containerized applications.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **AKS** is a **container orchestration service**.
- It **manages the lifecycle** of containers, making it easier to deploy and manage large fleets of containers.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: A service that manages container lifecycles, simplifying container fleet management.
- **Container Orchestration**: The automated process of managing container deployment, scaling, and operation.

#### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- AKS makes managing large fleets of containers **simpler and more efficient**.

#### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**
- **Lifecycle management**: AKS handles the **deployment, scaling, and updates** of containers in large applications.

### Containers in Microservice Architecture
- Containers are perfect for **microservice architecture**, where solutions are broken into **smaller, independent pieces**.
- Example: You can **split a website** into containers for **front end**, **back end**, and **storage**.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**
- **Microservice Architecture**: An architectural style where solutions are built using small, independent services (often using containers).

#### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- **Containers** allow for **scalability** and independent updates to different components of an app.

#### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**
- If your website's **back-end** reaches capacity, containers allow you to **scale** it independently without impacting the front end or storage.
