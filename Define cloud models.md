- **Private Cloud**: A cloud environment used by a single entity for greater control.
- **Public Cloud**: Cloud services built, controlled, and maintained by third-party providers.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: A mix of private and public clouds, offering flexibility and extra security.

- **Private Cloud**: 
    - Used by one entity.
    - Offers more control but higher costs.
    - Can be hosted on-site or off-site by third-party providers.
  
- **Public Cloud**:
    - Available to the general public.
    - Built and maintained by third-party cloud providers.
    - No capital expenditure needed, pay-as-you-go model.

- **Hybrid Cloud**:
    - Combines both private and public clouds.
    - Used for increased demand or extra security.
    - Organizations choose which services run in the public vs. private cloud.

- **Private Cloud**: Offers complete control but requires investment in hardware and maintenance.
- **Public Cloud**: No initial investment, but lacks full control over resources and security.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Most flexibility, letting companies decide where to run their applications.
