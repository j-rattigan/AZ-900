### **Cloud Models**  
Cloud models define the **deployment type** of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: **private**, **public**, and **hybrid**.

### **Private Cloud** 
| Model | ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**  | ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions:** | ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples:** |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Private Cloud**  | - Used by a **single entity** (organization, company). <br> - Offers **greater control** over IT services, but comes with **higher costs** and **fewer benefits**  compared to public clouds.  <br> | - A cloud dedicated to a single company or entity. <br> - More expensive than public clouds due to dedicated resources. | - Can be **hosted** in your **own data center** or a **dedicated third-party** data center. |
| **Public Cloud** | - **Public cloud** is **managed by a third-party provider** and is available for **anyone** to use. | - Accessible by anyone; services are **provided** by third parties (like Microsoft, AWS, Google Cloud). <br> - **Public availability**: The key difference between public and private clouds. | - Public clouds offer **scalable resources** for anyone who wants to buy cloud services. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | integrates both **private** and **public** clouds, providing flexibility and security. | - **Hybrid cloud**: Combines **private** and **public clouds** for a **flexible** environment. <br> - **Extra security**: Users decide what services to keep private and which to place in the public cloud. | - If there's **increased demand** for a temporary period, a **private cloud** can surge by using **public cloud** resources. |
| **Multi-cloud** | - Uses multiple **public cloud providers**. | - Managing cloud resources from **two or more providers** simultaneously. | - A company might use **AWS** for storage and **Azure** for computing resources. |
